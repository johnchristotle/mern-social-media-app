# MERN STACK APP - Friends-Connect #

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB to build a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "Friends-Connect" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to connect with friends and loves ones easily.

Via this project, I was able to develope strong understanding of how the MERN Stack works.

## Running The App ##
Setup:
simple run ```npm i && npm start``` for both front-end and back-end.
